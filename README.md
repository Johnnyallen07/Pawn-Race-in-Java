Implemented by Java swing only. I will update more functionalities including standard game and AI algorithm. 

# Pawn Race
Tips: 1. The specific location is recorded by TextField Component in Java Swing, so it ONLY starts after closing the side frame. 
2. The game is started from black side, and switch player each turn. Feel free to rotate your screen (it's just kidding, I will implement "Rotate" function to "utils" menus) 

## Structure 
The skeleton of the project is a little bit messy, even though I've tried my best to make it "readable". As I will upgrade and maintain the project, The skeleton will also be slightly upgraded.
